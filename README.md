## Junior Front-End Developer

### About
After three months of self-education, I have decided to improve my knowledge and skills and take part in a professional course provided by Software Development Academy. 
Day by day I am learning new tools and improving my development skills. I am strongly motivated to develop my future carrier in Front-end area.

I'm looking for a new job opportunity as a Junior Front-end Developer. I am based in Gdansk but I am open to working in remote as well as a hybrid model.
